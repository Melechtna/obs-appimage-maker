# OBS AppImage Maker

This is a script that I cooked up that leans on JuNest to create an up to date (latest release) appimage for OBS Studio Browser with as much as I could manage to enable, enabled. The resulting AppImage will be fairly bulky (nearly 600MB) But given installing cef to build OBS takes up 2.1GB, this is more than a fair trade IMO.

## Usage

The only deps you need locally should be git and wget.

Run the bash script, it does everything automatically. Or just download the latest release/remind me to update the release.

## Todo's
Add AJA, but likely someone else will need to deal with that one, if anyone genuienly wants it.
